# Frogfrogfrog

The initial idea: 

> Frog eating flies

The experience:

> The user controls a frog at the bottom of the screen, they can shoot out the frog's tongue and catch a fly which is moving on the screen. if the tongue hits the fly it gets eaten.

Basic things to do
- Draw the frog (image? circle)
- Draw the tongue
- Move the frog (how? mouse? keyboard?)
- Move the fly (how? in line? buzzing around? random?)
- Figure out if the tongue hits the fly?

Questions:

- What does the frog look like?
    - Circles!
- How does the user control the frog?
    - with mouse position (left and right)
    - user launches the tongue with a mouse click
    - 
- How does the fly move?
- The flys starts on the left at a random y position, and moves to the right in a line
- What does the tongue look like?
    - red line coming out of the frog
- What happens if the user doesn't catche the fly?
    - if the fly goes off the right side, it just resets
- What does it all look like on the screen? Layout?
