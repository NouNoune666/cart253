1. A foot with des verrues. 
Warts. I forgot what they were called. What to do with the warts? How is this a game?
2. A pimple popping game.
Inspired by all those pimple popping game adds I see on tiktok and instagram. It would have to be different than those. Kinda gross also.
3. A game where you need to find the traitor but it's very obvious.
I like this one. It's funny. Maybe you click on the traitor and it says good job. If you click on someone else it says no. Very simple. But the best part could be a cool design and drawings.
4. A cake making game.
How? Needs a twist.
5. A game where you need to cross the road, but you can only in a safe way.
Love safety. Could also be that you need to cross the road but you can never. Inspiration from construction on Montréal streets.
6. A game where you can get top surgery.
Okay so this needs improving, and also just comes from the fact that I want top surgery. But an educational game about different gender surgeries or medical transitionning could be great and would work great with another project I have. 
7. A game where all your meds or surgeries are approved by the RAMQ.
Very fun and simple and not realistic in real life! Could use pictures of real prescriptions. Cool look.
8. A game where your a biker and need to avoid the doors opening.
I feel like i've seen a game of this already. Maybe instead of crashing into the doors you enter battle mode with the driver. Or they apologise and move on.
9. A cleaning game where everything gets dirtier and impossible to clean.
Nightmare. Faisable!
10. A game where you need to straighten des cadres.
Inspired by my living room and its frames. Maybe a timer so there's a time motiviation. Click and drag. Fun and simple.
11. An apple picking game but some apples have secrets.
Litteraly what was I thinking. Love the idea though. It seems like an ordinary apple picking game but then you pick one mysterious apple and the screen becomes dark and there's cool sound design whispers.
12. An outfit chooser, but if you choose an ugly outfit it says YOUR UGLY.
Mean and I love it. Old school menu, just click an arrow and the top changes. Kinda like the dressup games in 2010. Needs a bit of improvement. What makes it ugly.
13. Something similar to the cooking mama franchise but crazy.
A bit complicated. Maybe cooking mama ends up poisining the food or something crazy.
14. A chose your own destiny that only ends with one destiny.
The destiny being that the game starts over?
15. A game where you only win and you always get a récompense that is a kitten.
Very fun game, all positive. But what would the game be concretely?
16. Scrolling through tiktok.
Ummm. I'm thinking more of an animation project here, I think.
17. A need where you need to cut a bagel in half, or even an avocado, and you can cut yourself.
Inspired by true events. Would have to make it very hard to cut. What happens when you cut yourself? Starts over maybe.
18. A supper where you need to avoid your problematic family members.
Also inspired by true events. How to avoid? What kind of problematic characters? What happends if you don't avoid them?
19. Making wishes when there's a étoile filante, but you can never finish writting your wishes.
How would the computer know that the wish is not done? A short writting time? Maybe an error message when people click enter to submit the wish? Idk about this one.
20. Pot pie eating competition.
21. Hot dog eating competition.
For both those ideas: How? A timer? Could be a fun simple game. With realistic pictures of hotdogs or pies and realistic sounds of pies? I love those contests.
22. Occupation double quizz.
For my roomates who love occupation double. I could do this as a personnal project will all their knowledge rather then for a class project.
