## Description

> *"Nou Noune's Art Jam" is a portrait assignment for Pippin Barr’s CART 253 class. It’s meant to give the user an idea of who I am — Amélie Barrette, aka Nou Noune.

> The experience is designed to be observed, with a touch of interactivity. Move the mouse around and see who’s following you (hint: her name starts with a B). Hold the mouse down on the mouth and you’ll hear the most wonderful cover sung in Simlish (the language of The Sims). If you release the mouse, you'll hear nothing except for what is actually around you. Wow, immersive!

> You’ll also discover some of my favorite things: my grandma’s cottage, starry nights, gems, nature, sims-related stuff and the big, beautiful, ever-changing sun.

## New p5 functions used.
