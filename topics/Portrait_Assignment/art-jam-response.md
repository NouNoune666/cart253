Art Jam Response by Amélie Barrette

Doggy, Doggy by Amanda
https://am-stormyr.github.io/cart253/topics/self-portrait/

The first Art Jam self-portrait that I really enjoyed was Doggy, Doggy by Amanda. I was immediately drawn to it because the background image looked familiar. It’s actually very close to where I live (fun fact!). I also appreciated that the portrait was made almost entirely from images rather than JavaScript shapes, which gave it a distinctive look.

The 3D scan of Amanda is super cool. Its slight imperfections give it an unsettling, almost uncanny feeling. It is as if it wants to move but cannot. The interactive aspect was another highlight; it made me feel like I was part of Amanda’s self-portrait, which was both engaging and fun. It’s simple, but it works perfectly! Adding the tongue and the following eye as JavaScript shapes was an especially playful touch.

Overall, I think this piece combines several techniques really well. There’s also a clear aesthetic with the text and cursor elements that gives off retro, video-game vibes. The sound design adds another layer. It’s both eerie and entertaining.

When looking at the code, I was impressed by how complex yet clear it was. Amanda used several booleans, such as soundStarted, ohHeyFinished, and somethingFunFinished, which caught my attention since I’m still learning how booleans work. The use of trigonometry for the tongue and eye animations was also really clever. Altogether, it’s a well-crafted and memorable project and definitely one of my favorites.

Character Color Customization by Lazer

Another self-portrait that I found really compelling was Character Color Customization by Lazer. As soon as I saw it, I was reminded of the kinds of small web games I used to find and play as a kid. It’s simple, fun, and surprisingly addictive. It is the kind of interactive piece that makes you want to keep experimenting for hours.

The endless color combinations make it even more engaging, and when I realized I could also draw in addition to changing colors with the sliders, it was a nice surprise. The multiple layers of interactivity made the piece even more captivating. If you don’t look at the code first, you have to figure out what each slider does through experimentation, which makes it playful and intuitive.

Looking at the code was also a great learning experience. I hadn’t seen how sliders worked before, but Lazer’s code was so well-organized that I understood it right away. It gave me a lot of inspiration for my own future projects and I'll definitely be using sliders soon!

Death by Boredom by Aydan

The last Art Jam project I want to highlight is Death by Boredom by Aydan. When I first saw this piece, I immediately loved its style. The drawings are colorful, lively, exaggerated, and funny!

I find creating drawings using only JavaScript shapes to be incredibly tedious, so my first thought was, “Did this person actually draw all of this using just shapes?” After looking through the code, I realized that, apart from the bee, everything was indeed hand-drawn with code. I was in awe!

Beyond the impressive drawing style, I also really enjoyed the sound design. It was playful, humorous, and character to the piece. The way the sounds and colors changed as the bee approached the boy made the whole experience feel both narrative and interactive.

Overall, Death by Boredom was a funny, creative, and technically impressive project that stood out to me.
