Ideas for title and instruction screen.
- Short animation with frog jumping.
Cute but complicated.
- Bunch of flies flying around.
Kind of like an animation and then game begins.
- Rainbow?
?
- Classic click to play but the mouse is the frog.
Cute.
- Fade in.
Boring
- Instruction screen. !!!
I want to learn how to do that so this one.

Ideas for the end of the game.
- Frog needs a certain amount of flies or else it dies.
Basic and simple but good.
- Flie gets bigger and so does sound, until it takes up the whole screen.
Trippy.
- Frog eats poisoned flie and dies. !!!
This could be added but I can't be the only reason why it dies.
- Make it impossible to win.
Fun but not for this game.
- Frog pukes from to many flies. !!!
So the frog would have to take a break and wait a bit, you could see the frog hunger level or fullness level in the scoring system. Either you die of hunger, being too full or being poisoned. Screen becomes black with text and audio effect and prompts to go back to home screen.
- Frog is confronted by flie's mom and is sad.
Love this. 
- Countdown?
Basic.

Scoring system (not basic numbers).
- Background changes color, from red to green?
Nice but not clear.
- Cool sport score board. 
Needs to show the fullness level of the frog.
- Flies are displayed at top corner.
Same comment as before.
- Vial fills up. !!!
Fullness vial!! From hungry to too full.
- If you miss flies you lose lives (little hearts in the corner).
no 

New kinds of fly movement.
- Wave like movement. !!!
Random wave movement yes
- When fly hits end of screen it goes back (like ping pong).
But then there would be to many flies.
- Some flies slower or faster then others (random speed). !!!
Yes!
- No gravity.
- Fly leaves trace.
- Move the frog with the mouse??

New audio or visual effects.
- Add background visuals that look cool.
I mean of course!
- Add sound to each element. !!
of course
- Tears fall down frog?
- Make frog look cooler. !!!
Add a jetpack since he can fly
- Cool kal√©idoscope effect.
Why not, but we will see.
- Add background image.
down
- Maybe the audio added doesnt make sense. Ex: barking when the frog catches the fly. !!!
yes

2 other elements (1 new control system.)
- Some flies are poisonous, when you catch them you die. !!!
- Moving the frog with the mouse. !!!
maybe more with the wasd and it flies.
- X to launch the tongue.
- The longer you press X the farther it goes.
How about arrow up and arrow down for the tongue !!!
- C to bring back the tongue. 
- Frog has a backpack to fly!!!
Yes i like that.
