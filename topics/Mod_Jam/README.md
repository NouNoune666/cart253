# HUNGRY FROG

A game about a hungry flying frog.
- Hover over flies to eat them.
- Eat the yummy flies (the black ones) and don't eat the poisonous ones (the red ones).
- Catch as many flies as you can before the sun sets.
- If you go too long without eating, you'll starve and die :/

Project instructions

1. A title and instructions screen. Could the frog be used to start the game? Could the frog eat the title?
> Done, the frog did not eat the title, however. Went for a retro vibe.
2. An ending. How should the game end? Because the frog explodes with flies? Because it starves? How can you tell the game is over?
> Made many different endings: starving, poison fly, and a good one!
3. A scoring system. But not just a standard number counting up on the screen.
> There's a score system for the number of flies eaten (which you see at the end if you survive) and a placement system that tracks the hunger level of the frog.
4. New kinds of fly movement. Sine wave? Random movement? Perlin noise? Teleportation? Controlled by a second player?
> I made the tongue controllable with up arrow and down arrow but decided not to keep it. You'll see that as I've commented out those decisions. The flies come in waves now, and they have a random X and Y.
5. New visual and/or audio effects. Frogâ€™s eyes follow the fly? Sound effects for all major actions? Fly flaps its wings? Frog hops around instead of sliding?
> You'll see some audio effects as well as fly, frog and background design! This was made on Photoshop by me.


For a perfect score, make sure to add at least two other features to the experience. 

> Now the frog is moved by the mouse's X and Y.
> Added poisonous flies to the mix.
> Added starving as a possibility.
> Idk, I did other cool things, I think!
